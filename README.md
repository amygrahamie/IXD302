*I love pinterest because it doesn't narrow down your ideas, its a constant pool of inspiration. I kept coming back to my pinterest board for this project whenever I needed some inspiration or direction when I got stuck or something wasn't working.*

*When I created this moodboard I was going for bright bold colours, which ties in well with the National Geographics logo colour although I didnt stick to this style for long and ended up going for deeper more subdued colours.*
